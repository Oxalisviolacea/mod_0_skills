# Assign a variable called food a string value of your choosing
food = "chocolate"

# Assign a variable called is_delicious to a boolean value
is_delicious = true

# Re-assign your food variable to a new string
food = "banana"

# Assign a variable called num2 to a numerical value
num2 = 2

# Assign a variable called num7 to a different numerical value
num7 = 7

# divide num7 by num2 and store the result in a variable called quotient
quotient = num7 / num2

# Assign a variable called songs to an array of strings
songs = ["Hurricane", "Blowin' in the Wind", "Don't Think Twice"]

# You may use google for the following two:
#Write a line of code that removes the first element from the songs array

last_two_songs = songs.drop(1)
puts last_two_songs

#Write a line of code that asks how many characters there are in the food string
character_count = food.length
puts character_count
